# bank_churn_project
Use machine learning to predict customer churn for a bank.

## Overview

Weâ€™ve been hired by a Norsk Bank to determine the likelihood of customer churn by using machine learning models. Our goal is to generate a model that has the best accuracy and f1 score which would provide the best method to determine the bank customers likelihood of remaining a bank customer or leaving the bank. Identifying a model that best predicts this can greatly improve customer retention which in turn will improve bank revenue. Banks generate revenue through selling products like bank loans and accounts to customers. Keeping and maintaining a good relationship with customers would ultimately mean customers will take on more bank products. 

Our team has found reliable data on Kaggle that will help us determine how to improve customer attrition. Using feature engineering and preprocessing to improve the readability of the data to bring relevant numbers to our model. The goal of our model is to find the best correlation with customer attrition. This data will be presented to the Norsk Bank to help them reduce customer churn.
